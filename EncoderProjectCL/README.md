Hello! Thank you for checking out my project. My name is Devon O’Dell and this is my project submission for Code Louisville’s Software Development Course 1. I built a modular encryption program using a simple plugin system that allows you to write a sentence or phrase and it will return what you typed, but in code. What makes this interesting is that the plugin structure allows you to use different encryption algorithms without having to alter the program itself. This allows for better organization, as any tools you want to introduce simply need to be placed in an external “Plugins” folder, and you can read the names and descriptions of any files that are compatible in the plugins folder using the “Help” command at runtime.
